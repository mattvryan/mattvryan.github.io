title: Pro Tip - Do Not Write E-Mails While On Ambien
---
Apparently, drugs can mess with your mind, and stuff.

Some time ago I was attending Microsoft’s TechReady conference in Seattle with a few of my teammates.  I don’t sleep well when I’m away from home so I generally take Ambien at night to help me sleep so I’m not a complete disaster during the days at the conference.

One night at the beginning of the week I had already taken my Ambien and was waiting for it to kick in.  Since I needed to sync up on some schedule planning with one of my teammates I decided to fire off a quick e-mail.  Whoops.  It really wasn’t helpful, but it was pretty funny.

I really have no idea what most of this is even about, but you can definitely tell that I’m falling asleep along the way.  I’ve fast-forwarded to the good part.  (Names and confidential details removed.)

> I would feel better about this if I knew [teammate] was covering the stuff I’m missing.  Let’s start talking that way tomorrow when we are trying to decide when we cn a plansll.  I sent out an unvitation to a dinner at cheesecake factorqay, so [teammate] shoule llo ve that.  We can findine the meetin schedule over dinner therer.  Then wenb we get back to the olifwe 8 yu  can sweettak the peoples into getting gus a meeting room on the cheap. Maybeww sese ccan we=just meet here insteaed ov hainf to go find someppleace priavete to have our team planinig sessin.If those schedules also work for [teammate] that gives us two longish sections where we wcould gt stuff done, hopeulllf at some time when Im not so tierad as I am now.  I thin k the ambien is really kickin in.
