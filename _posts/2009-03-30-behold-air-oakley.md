Every soul that comes to this earth is born with their own set of talents.  It is our marvelous opportunity as parents to tell our children what their talents are, and get them to develop the correct talents and ignore their natural talents if necessary, in order to plan for our retirement.

So you can imagine my absolute joy and relief to see this awesome sight and capture it digitally:  My son, Oakley, slam-dunking a basketball.  Now I know some of you are doing to hate on this, noting that the rim is not all the way up, but rather sitting down at about 8 1/2 feet.  So he can only dunk at 8 1/2 feet for now – big deal.  We’ll see about a 10 foot rim when he turns 2.
