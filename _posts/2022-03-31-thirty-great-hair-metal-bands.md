title: Thirty Great Hair Metal Bands
published: True
---
This month on Facebook I declared March "Hair Metal Month" and throughout the month we celebrated hair metal by spotlighting 30 different hair metal bands.

In the world today there sure is a lot of conflict.  We had this in the 80s also, but then hair metal was born, and within a few years the Berlin Wall came down, the USSR dissolved, and things got a lot better.  Maybe we should ditch all this modern garbage on the radio - and country, in particular - and go back to the really good stuff.

Anyway, here are the 30 bands:
- Britny Fox
- Bon Jovi
- Cinderella
- Def Leppard
- Dokken
- E’nuff Z’nuff
- Europe
- Firehouse
- Great White
- Hurricane
- Kix
- Lillian Axe
- Motley Crue
- MSG
- Ozzy
- Poison
- Quiet Riot
- Ratt
- Roxy Blue
- Saints & Sinners
- Skid Row
- Steel Dragon
- Steelheart
- Stryper
- Telsa
- Twisted Sister
- Warrant
- White Lion
- Whitesnake
- Winger
