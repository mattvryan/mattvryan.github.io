title: Thirty Great Hair Metal Bands
published: True

This month on Facebook I declared March "Hair Metal Month" and throughout the month we celebrated hair metal by spotlighting 30 different hair metal bands.

In the world today there sure is a lot of conflict.  We had this in the 80s also, but then hair metal was born, and within a few years the Berlin Wall came down, the USSR dissolved, and things got a lot better.  Maybe we should ditch all this modern garbage on the radio - and country, in particular - and go back to the really good stuff.

Anyway, here are the 30 bands, and my vote for their "best" song:
- Britny Fox - "Long Way to Love"
- Bon Jovi - "Wanted Dead or Alive"
- Cinderella - "Don't Know What You Got ('Til It's Gone)"
- Def Leppard - "Rock of Ages"
- Dokken - "Alone Again"
- E’nuff Z’nuff - "Fly High Michelel"
- Europe - "Rock the Night"
- Firehouse - "When I Look Into Your Eyes"
- Great White - "House of Broken Love"
- Hurricane - "Over the Edge"
- Kix - "Tear Down the Walls"
- Lillian Axe - "The Day I Met You"
- Mötley Crüe - "Wild Side"
- MSG - "Gimme Your Love"
- Ozzy Osbourne - "Flying High Again"
- Poison - "Cry Tough"
- Quiet Riot - "Come On Feel the Noise"
- Ratt - "You're In Love"
- Roxy Blue - "Times Are Changin'"
- Saints & Sinners - "We Belong"
- Skid Row - "18 and Life"
- Steel Dragon - "We All Die Young"
