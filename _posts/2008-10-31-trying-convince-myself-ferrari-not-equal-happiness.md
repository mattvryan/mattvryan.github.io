title: Trying to Convince Myself that Ferrari != Happiness
---
It is said that possessions alone do not make you happy. This is true; sometimes you find the happiness through other people’s possessions instead.

Another common belief about money is that the love of money is the root of all evil. This is also true – you should not love your money.

What you should do is give your money to Ferrari, in exchange for an F430. Or, make friends with someone who has a Ferrari, so their possessions can make you happy instead.

If you are like me, and you just can’t find anyone with a Ferrari to be friends with (or, can’t hide the superficiality of pretending to want to be friends with someone who has one already), the next best thing is to make friends with someone like Kyle who has a friend that will loan him his Ferrari F430 for the day in order to help Kyle complete his Halloween costume of “a successful person.”

And then, of course, you have to be selected for a ride. Gratefully Kyle stopped by my cube first thing after he got to work this morning and asked if I wanted to go for a ride. When I looked at him, he showed the Ferrari key, completing the thought. A ride in a Ferrari? Is there really any other answer to that question than an emphatic “Of course!”?

When I walked outside this is what I found – a beautiful silver-gray Ferrari F430 Spider:

We got in, carefully, and gingerly – getting in is a bit of a feat, especially if you are 6’2″. Kyle inserted the key, then pressed the starter button and that wonderful 480hp Ferrari V8 roared to life. We slowly pulled out of the parking lot here at Mozy and then onto the freeway.

If I had one of these, I might just drive it onto the freeway all day long, just pulling off so I could pull back on again.

This car is incredible. I must have said that ten times during the drive. The seats were incredibly comfortable; the side bolsters securely hold you in place, so much so that when going through corners you don’t even feel the lateral g forces. The car is firmly planted on the road with no body roll through corners. And hearing that Ferrari V8 climb through the gears as you click them off with the paddle shifter – wow.

We cruised along the freeway at what felt like a crawl but was actually around 80 mph.

If you look closely you can see that we are well below the 8500 rpm redline, but at near redline for most normal cars. The engine sounds so nice you just can’t think of shifting to a lower gear.

Oh, that black rectangle in the dash, pictured in the lower right corner? Yeah, that is the stereo. You don’t really use that thing in a Ferrari – it muffles the sound system in back, pictured here:

So we're driving down the freeway at about 90, hoping to not find any cops. If I had this car, I don’t know how I would possibly avoid getting a ticket. It is so easy to take it up over 90; this car gets there before you know it, without even thinking about it. And it doesn’t even feel like you are going fast, other than the fact that you are blowing by everyone else on the road.

After leaving the freeway we went down into town to return to work via this nice curvy road called Pleasant Grove Boulevard. Speed limit on Pleasant Grove Boulevard is 40. We were taking those curves at 80 without even thinking about it. It didn’t even feel like we were pushing it at all. Simply amazing.

I didn’t get to drive this car myself. Oh, I wanted to. But it wasn’t loaned to me, it was loaned to Kyle. There’s no way I’d even ask. Besides, even just getting to ride in it was awesome, and enough.

Still, here’s a picture of me wearing a Ferrari. I think it looks pretty good on me.

That does it. Someday, someday…
