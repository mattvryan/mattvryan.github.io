title: What's In a Good Computer Game?
---
Is it really so hard to create a really good computer game?

One of my favorite computer games of all time is Microsoft’s Motocross Madness 2. They did a lot of things right with MCM2.

If you aren’t familiar, MCM2 is a motocross racing game. Although I do truly enjoy racing games, there are a few key things that make this game special.

The track builder is the biggest thing. Microsoft made available the Armadillo track editor, which admittedly is a pretty poor piece of software. But enough people have figured out how to use this thing well enough to create some amazing tracks. For example, you can download literally hundreds of different tracks, including replicas of almost every track on the AMA Motocross circuit, as well as replicas of supercross tracks from past series. This alone makes the game. Why is it that almost no other racing games offer this feature?

Skins are another big thing. In fact, I went through the work to create a skin that looks an awful lot like my very own 1998 KX 250 with the Factory Effex graphics kit. I have another skin that looks an awful lot like my own Thor Core 5 gear. So, yes, I can play myself, on my own KX 250, flying down Mt. St. Helen at Glen Helen if I wish. This way, I only virtually break my collarbone, again.

I first bought this game in 2001 and I am still playing it. If you can find a copy, you can usually get it for pretty cheap (I’m seeing them on eBay right now for less than $10). Personally, I wouldn’t sell you my copy for $100. I’m still improving, too. For example, after I thought I had the game mastered, I realized that you can actually seat-bounce off the jumps. Yes, you do really go farther if you do it right.

The price point, the replay capability, and the variety afforded by the skins and the track editor is what makes this game.

Oh, and one more thing: The ability to go anywhere in the level I want to, not just on the track. Sure, you have to go into practice mode, but at least you can ride the track backwards, or go anywhere else for that matter.

Let’s compare to another racing game I have, NASCAR Thunder 2003 for GameCube. There are a lot of available tracks, but I cannot create new ones. Skinning options are limited. And, no driving backwards on the track!

When the newer version came out, I went into the local game store and asked the salesperson about it.

“It’s a pretty good game,” he said.

“Hmm,” I replied. “Can you drive backwards on the track?”

He looked at me pretty funny. “Uh, no. Why would you want to do that?”

“Because it is fun,” I said.

What is wrong with these people?

Sure, sometimes I want to race for real, and see how well I can do. And sometimes, I want to start the race, turn around, and race backwards, and see how spectacularly I can crash head-on into the oncoming traffic.

It seems like the game making folks forget this. A computer game is meant to be an alternate reality. It isn’t true life. In true life, Chad Reed doesn’t race my KX 250 on a track of my own design, but in MCM2 he does, whenever I want him to. In true life, I’m much too chicken to seek out hostile aliens armed only with a crowbar, but I dare do it in Half-Life. And in true life, I would never dream of driving the wrong direction on the road into oncoming traffic, for a myriad of reasons. But it is pretty fun to do in a computer game.

At least, I assume it would be, if EA hadn’t been so dumb as to disallow it in NASCAR Thunder.

This is why The Sims is a popular game, and why it is fun – but only if you play it right. Most people I know who play The Sims try to play it the “correct” way. Playing the correct way goes like this:

* Get up in the morning when you are still tired
* Skip breakfast so you can be to work on time
* Spend all day at work
* Come home and eat
* Have a brief moment of enjoyment before you have to go to bed
* Rinse and repeat

Gee, that sounds just like real life. You know what – I do that routine every day. Why would I want to play a game that is just like my real life? Yuck!

Now, when you use the cheat codes, the game becomes fun! Ctrl+Shift+C will open a command box where you can type “klapaucius” or “rosebud” (depending on the version you have) to increase your bank balance. Instead of working every day in order to sleep in a tiny house, you can play all day long in a mansion! You can build an indoor pool! You can play basketball in the house! You can put a full-size jacuzzi in your bedroom! You can hire a maid to clean up after you! See? Alternate reality!

This is also really the only way you can find the time to quickly create meaningful relationships with multiple people. If you want to create Sim soap operas this is a necessity. For example, you can get several of the girls across the street to fall in love with you, or you can pick a fight with your neighbor, and then trap him in a room with no door for as long as it takes. Hey, he should be nicer to you in your own house.

This cheat code is also an absolute necessity if you are going to play Sim Survivor.

It’s too bad that you have to contort the game in order to make it fun. Did they forget what normal people do all the time? Did they forget that a computer game is supposed to be an alternate reality, not a depressing reminder of how lame your real life is?

This is why MCM2 is a great game. Playing it the way it was intended to be played means that you can do whatever you want. Sure, ride your motorcycle down that ski jump if you want to. Make your own supercross track with whoops that are 50 feet high, just to see what happens. Or make a rhythm section that can only be done quickly in exactly one way, if you seat bounce the section in the middle.
