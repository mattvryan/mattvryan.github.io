title: Roosevelt Car Show 2010
---
Last Saturday me and my Z went to Roosevelt, Utah, to participate in the annual car show there, because that’s where my family lives, and my dad and my brother and I all thought it would be fun to put our cars in the show together.

It was fun, too, even if none of us won anything.  It was fun just being there with my dad and brother and having people walk by and wonder why I parked my 350Z there.

Here’s my car parked in between my brother’s Mustang (background) and my dad’s Econoline (not pictured).  I washed and vacuumed and scrubbed and detailed that car for about three hours before the show, and I must say it looked really fine.  Oddly, right after the show ended, it rained for about 30 seconds, just long enough to get my car dirty again.  Oh well.

Dad just started working on this 1961 Ford Econoline van. It is pretty sweet. I love the all white paint with the black accents and the very subtle gray pinstripe all around. He’s got a 302 in the doghouse inside the van and plans to redo the interior next.

The story on those wheels is pretty cool. He was looking for those exact wheels by American Racing, Torq Thrust IIs, and looked all over for the sizes he needed (two different sizes, front and rear). The fronts, 14x6s, were nearly impossible to find. Then he called one place who just happened to have two of them left, along with six of the size he needed for the rears. So he took two of each, and the dealer was thrilled to get rid of his two 14x6s and even himself out with four remaining of the other size.

In the foreground is my brother’s 2009 Ford Mustang GT. He’s added a Roush bodykit and Shelby Super Snake wheels and a lowered suspension so far. He wonders if it is weird to have Shelby wheels and a Roush body kit, but I think it is cool to make your own Mustang that has your favorite components from each builder.

My dad is mayor of Roosevelt, so I went with him to drive this to the show. If you lived more than a half mile from the fire department and had a fire back then, there was really no point in calling the fire department. It’s a neat truck though.

I want to say this is a ’32 Ford but I’m really not sure. I do know it belongs to my dad’s friend Mike Mahoney, who has like 30 cars.

Another Ford coupe, ’31 or ’32 (I really should learn to tell the difference). This one belongs to another of my dad’s friends, Dennis Peterson. Dennis restored this car himself, repairing all the rust and pounding out all the dents and smoothing out the whole body by hand. He is incredibly talented. He also did all the body work on my dad’s Econoline and is currently working on another project which will be pretty awesome when it is done.

When Dad and I brought the fire truck into the show we followed this ’70 or ’71 (again, can’t remember) Dodge Dart. I wondered to myself if it belonged to my cousin (okay fine, my mom's cousin) Joe Gardner. I was right. As long as I can remember Joe has restored a number of really cool Mopar cars – Chargers, Challengers, Darts, Superbees, etc.

This mostly stock gray 2007 Mustang GT beat my brother’s 2009 Mustang GT somehow, which goes to show that the people who judge the shows don’t always know what they are doing. I mean, it’s a nice looking Mustang, but doesn’t have nearly as much done to it as my brother’s does.

![White 3DCarbon Mustang GT](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4809154946_cb603e6923.jpg)

If any Mustang there was better than my brother’s, it was this white 3DCarbon Mustang pictured here.

This blue ’31 or ’32 Ford coupe won some award, maybe for best 30’s car? Or most unique? Can’t remember. Take a look at this engine though, for a clue as to why:

![Sweet Engine](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4808532063_e1e8e98abb.jpg)

Now that is a sweet engine.

![Flathead Offenhauser](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4808531185_3a1a3e6bff.jpg)

The roadster carrying this sweet litttle Offy won Best In-Progress Car. Which seems kinda like a weird award, since pretty much all the cars there would be considered “in-progress.”

![Beautiful 50s Chevy](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4809153564_8a0b5f6a31.jpg)

This is a beautiful car. Look carefully and you can see the well-done ghosted flames along the side. It won Best 50s Car and, since the owner drove it all the way from Riverside, California, it also won an award for furthest distance traveled to attend the show.

![Best Of Show 2010 - 1937 Ford Coupe](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4809152752_a0b49435fb.jpg)

This 1937 Ford Coupe from Vernal, Utah won Best Of Show and definitely deserved it. Which is much better than the week before, at another car show in Vernal, where this car was beaten for Best Of Show by a bone-stock straight-off-the-showroom-floor 2010 Camaro. This car is a beautiful work of art from every angle and no detail is left undone.

Just check out the beautifully done interior:

![1931 Ford Vicky](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4808530687_52e206ede4.jpg)

This beautiful chopped and dropped ’31 Ford Vicky had to sit next to the ’37 Ford above, so it had a rough go. It definitely deserved to win something, so I’m glad my dad chose to give it the Mayor’s Choice award.
