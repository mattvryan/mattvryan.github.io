title: Goodbye Z
---
A couple of weeks ago, on a very conflicted day, I finally sold my 2003 Nissan 350Z.

Back in January, Amber and I realized that we needed to sell the Z.  As much as I wanted to keep it, I knew it needed to go.  Among other things, I knew it was going to need new tires again before the end of the year, to replace the tires I put on it just last spring.  Running through an $1100 set of new tires every year is just not within my budget.

I put it up for sale online and had interest pretty quickly, where “interest” is defined as “drooling teenage boys wondering if I will give my car away to them for nothing.”  So after enduring that for a number of months, I was so pleased when a mature gentleman with a thing for cars expressed some interest.  After he took the car for a test drive, he was in love.  Who could blame him?

Even though he was taking my baby away, I felt pretty happy because I know he’s gonna take good care of her.  Pretty much, I figure that is what it will feel like when my girls get married.

As a final act of affection, I washed the Z up good and had Amber take some pictures for posterity.  You can access the whole set [here](https://picasaweb.google.com/alien.czar/350Z?feat=directlink).
