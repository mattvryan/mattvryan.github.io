title: Thirty Great Classic Rock Bands
published: True

Last month was Hair Metal March.  This month was Classic Rock April.  These are the people who brought us great music and paved the way for all the good music that has come since.  These are the people who are certainly a bit miffed at what's happened with modern music.  These are the people to whom we owe the responsibility of bringing the good stuff back.

Starting in April, I tried also picking a "best album" although I admit sometimes I skipped it.

Here are the 30 great classic rock bands for April:
